Relax-CG:      Relaxation of a SiH system using conjugate gradients.
Relax-Broyden: Relaxation of a SiH system using the Broyden method.
Relax-Constraints: Relaxation of a slab representing a surface
                   (fixing the positions of "bulk" atoms)
Relax-ZM:      An example of the use of Zmatrix coordinates to enforce 
               chemically meaningful constraints.
VariableCell:  Combined relaxation of atomic positions and lattice vectors.
               Relax-CG uses conjugate-gradients
               Relax-PR uses "quenched" Parrinello-Rahman dynamics.
