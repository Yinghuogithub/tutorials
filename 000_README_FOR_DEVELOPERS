Please make sure that your files are readable/executable by the group,

ie, use at least "chmod 640" for normal files,
                 "chmod 750" for executable scripts
                 "chmod 750" for directories

Before the start of the Tutorial sessions, make sure that your directory
is "clean", i.e., no output files, etc.

If you re-arrange the directory structure, make sure to update the
symbols in Config/tutorial.bashrc
