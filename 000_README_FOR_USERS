Use the "tuto_update" scripts to update the SIESTA directory
when you are told to do so or if you feel that your copy has
been corrupted. Take care to save any files that you might want
to conserve, as it is not guaranteed that the update process will
keep them.

If you want to start from scratch, you can copy "tuto_update" to your
home directory, remove the SIESTA directory, and run "tuto_update".
Again, take care to save any files that you might want
to conserve.
