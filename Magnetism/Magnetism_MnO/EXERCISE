Initialization of different magnetic order in a magnetic insulator
(MnO), and analyzing the results.

The aim of the exercise: to learn setting up a calculation
in a bulk (crystal) system composed of "magnetic" (i.e., 3d)
and "non-magnetic" (s-p) atoms, whereby spin moments of "magnetic"
atoms may be arranged in different types of magnetic orderings,
and hence allow different (metastable) magnetic solutions. 
Analyze the results of converged calculations, demonstrating the type
of magnetic ordering in each of the cases considered.

WORD OF CAUTION:
3d oxydes are notorious examples of systems in which Coulomb correlation
effects play an important role, so that the "conventional" DFT treatment
is in some senses misledaing: the insulating band gaps are underestimated,
and the placement of main features of the band structure not consistent
with spectroscopic experiments. A large part of these inconsistencies
can be fixed by applying the "LDA+U" formalism. 
Another complication is that the crystal
structure of real 3d oxydes, basically very close to the B1 (NaCl) type,
undergoes slight but noticeable distortions which help to stabilize
one or another magnetic phases.
However, in the hystorical context as well as for didactic purposes, 
conventional DFT calculations, done in a nominally cubic lattice,
play an important role.
In MnO, the system under study in the present exercise, the origin
of antiferromagnetism can be understood; the correct antiferromagnetic
phase has the lowest total energy and a band gap, following already
from the results of conventional GGA calculation.

THE WORK: -----------------------------------------------------
Neglecting very small distortions which occur in different magnetic
phases, MnO has a B1 (NaCl) structure. The latter is described in
 MnO_FM.fdf 
input file as follows:

LatticeConstant     4.43 Ang
(experimental value, kept constant throughout the present exercise)

%block LatticeVectors
 0.00     0.50      0.50
 0.50     0.00      0.50
 0.50     0.50      0.00
%endblock LatticeVectors
(as usual for the B1 structure)

and two atoms in the unit cell:
AtomicCoordinatesFormat ScaledCartesian
%block AtomicCoordinatesAndAtomicSpecies
 0.000   0.000   0.000  1
 0.500   0.500   0.500  2
%endblock AtomicCoordinatesAndAtomicSpecies

In order to run a spin-polarized calculation, we set

SpinPolarized           .true

and moreover initialize non-zero (in fact, maximal) spin on Mn site:

%block DM.InitSpin       # Describe the initial magnetic order (on Mn only)
 1   +
%endblock DM.InitSpin

The rest of the input file sets calculation parameters (GGA, k-mesh,
mesh cutoff, ...) and notably provides printing out Mulliken populations:

WriteMullikenPop  1

saving charge (and magnetic) density,
SaveRho           
and writing down the density of states:

%block ProjectedDensityOfStates
 -25.0  10.0  0.1   700   eV
%endblock ProjectedDensityOfStates

This output part will be identical for calculations with different
magnetic orderings.

Tasks:

1. As the calculation is down, check the local (on Mn and O sites)
and total (per unit cell) magntic moments. Plot spin-resolved
density of states (total and that for Mn and O sites).

2. Prepare the input file(s) for antiferromagnetc structures of MnO
and run the calculations. Note that an antiferromagnetic ordering 
doubles the unit cell: it contains now two Mn atoms (with opposite
spins) and, correspondingly, two O atoms. Don't forget to introduce
changes in
NumberOfAtoms,
lattice vectors, and atomic coordinates.
We'll consider two different antiferromagnetic structures:
AF1 has, what is called, the [001] ordering, that is, all Mn atoms
in a given [001] plane are equivalent (has the same spin orientation),
and between the consecutive [001] planes the spin orioentations
alternate.
AF2 has the [111] ordering, that is, equivalent spin orientation
is throughout a given [111] plane, and alternates between such planes.
Prepare the 
%block LatticeVectors
for AF1 and AF2 cases. Check that the unit cell volume (mixed product
of three lattice vectors) is twice that of the FM case (which equals 1/4).
Provide coordinates of (four) atoms, initialize spins in opposite sense
at two Mn atoms, and run the calculations.

3. Check Mulliken populations; plot total (from corresponding DOS files)
and (optionally) atom-resolved densities of states. 
Check that the AF structures have pronounced band gaps.

4. Using the calculated RHO, visualize the spin density in each
magnetic structure. You'll see that the spin density has nearly perfect
spherical distribution in the vicinity of Mn sites; why?

5. For the AF2 structure, you can find in the occupied part
of the Mn3d-related density of states two groups of peaks, related to
t2g and eg states of Mn. Try to vizualize them separately, selecting
for each of these groups a corresponding energy interval and calculating
LDOS. Why the separation into t2g and eg states is not so neat
in the AF1 structure?
