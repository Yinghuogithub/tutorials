This directory contains structure and magnetic moments
for a Co13 cluster.
The file co13+spin.XSF contains atomic positions 
(columns 2-4) and spin vectors (columns 5-7) for each of 13 atoms.

Exercice:

show the cluster with spin moments represented by arrows.
Try different modi of representing the atomic structure
(click on icons in the panel on the right from the XCrySDen
main window).
Try to modify size, color etc. of atoms.
Change the settings for the force representations.
