This is a package of exercises for Siesta Tutorials. 

The material is scattered in different subdirectories, and a given edition
of the tutorial can use its own selection, hopefully using symbolic names
and an easier to follow menu. For now, this package can be used to
test the installation.

There are some site-specific items here and there. Use your own judgement to
adapt them to your site.

All the examples should run with (at-least) siesta-2.0.2-rc44.

See the INSTALL file for installation instructions.
