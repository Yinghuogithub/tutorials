Dipole correction

When a slab-like system is not symmetric (because of different
terminations or due to the presence of an absorbate), it develops a
dipole which, due to the periodic boundary conditions, creates an
electric field in the vacuum. Far from the slab the field is constant
(and so the potential linear).

This spurious field can be compensated by an externally applied one, which
is formally created by a dipole layer in the vacuum (far enough from the slab).

In this directory we work with a somewhat non-physical example: a slab
made of a layer of water molecules with their dipoles oriented along
the z axis. The layer is just one big dipole.

Currently the value of the applied field has to be guessed.

You can use the macroave utility to process the .VH files to see the
potential profile. Plots are available in the Plots directory.
