        Bulk Properties of Si

1) Study the dependence with basis size (PAO.BasisSize)
   The basis will be generated using the default parameters.
   directory: Size
2) Study the dependence with basis range (PAO.EnergyShift) 
   You will modify the cutoff radious of the 1st zeta
   directory: Range
3) The role of the 2nd zeta (PAO.Splitnorm): the matchign radious (directory: Shape-Splitnorm) 
4) The soft confinning potential (directory: Shape-Vsoft)
