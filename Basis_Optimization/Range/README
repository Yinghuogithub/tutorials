In this example you are going to study how the properties of
bulk silicon depend on the range of the basis orbitals (DZP).

Run the examples of each subdirectory and see which one reproduces
the best values of the lattice constant and bulk modulus. Run your
own examples modifying the value of the energy shift (PAO.EnergyShift)

Compare the same orbital generated using different Eshifts. 
The orbitals are stored in the ORB* files:
ORB.Sl.z.Label

l -> l quantum number of the orbital
z -> which of the functions with the same l
Label -> The label specified in the ChemicalSpeciesLabel block

Remember: the orbitals stored in the ORB* files are divided by r**l
