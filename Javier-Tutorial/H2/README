WARNING: BEFORE RUNNING A CALCULATION FOR PRODUCTION,
TEST THE PSEUDOPOTENTIAL AND BASIS SETS, AND PERFORM
THE CONVERGENCE TESTS (MESH CUTOFF, ETC.) 

IN THE PRESENT EXAMPLES, AND IN ORDER TO SPEED THE CALCULATIONS,
WE PROVIDE SOME VALUES OF THESE PARAMETERS FOR YOU.

WE DO NOT WARRANTY THAT THE VALUES OF THESE PARAMETERS ARE CONVERGED.

* Inspect the input file, h2.fdf, and examine in detail 
the different input variables. More information can be obtained from 
the Siesta web page (http://www.icmab.es/siesta), following the link 
Documentations, and then Manual.

* Run the code for a set of different interatomic distances.
For instance, from 0.40 Ang to 3.00 Ang in steps of 0.10 Ang.
Save each output file in a separate file:

siesta < h2.fdf > h2.your_interatomic_distance.out

* Tabulate the total energy as a function of the interatomic distance.
In order to get this, type:

grep "Total =" h2.*.out > h2.distance.dat

* Edit the h2.distance.dat file with your favorite text editor,
and leave only two columns:
the first with the interatomic distance (in this case, in Angstroms),
and the second with the total energy (in this case, in eV).
At the end, it should look like this:

0.40     -23.866759
0.50     -27.849742
0.60     -29.650016

* Plot the total energy as a function of the interatomic distance.
