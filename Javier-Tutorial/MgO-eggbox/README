WARNING: BEFORE RUNNING A CALCULATION FOR PRODUCTION,
TEST THE PSEUDOPOTENTIAL AND BASIS SETS, AND PERFORM
THE CONVERGENCE TESTS FOR THE MESH CUTOFF AND THE SAMPLING IN K-SPACE.

IN THE PRESENT EXAMPLES, AND IN ORDER TO SPEED THE CALCULATIONS,
WE PROVIDE SOME VALUES OF THESE PARAMETERS FOR YOU.

WE DO NOT WARRANTY THAT THE VALUES OF THESE PARAMETERS ARE CONVERGED.

* Edit the input file,  MgO.fdf, and study the different variables.
Pay special attention to the variables we are focusing on, and
check their meaning in the User's Guide:
   MeshCutoff
   %block AtomicCoordinatesOrigin

* To study the "egg box" effect we are going to run several simulations
shifting the real space grid with respect to the atomic coordinates. 
We are going to use the script autosiesta.py for this. This scripts
runs siesta giving different values to a chosen parameter of the 
SystemLabel.fdf file. The series of values it will assign is defined 
in its input file SystemLabel.in. 

* Edit the MgO.in file and see how the series is defined 
by a minimum and a maximum value, and a number of steps. The 
ParameterLabel is the tag the script will search in the 
SystemLabel.fdf file. Find the ParameterLabel in the siesta input file
and make sure it coincides with that in the script input file.

* The shift in AtomicCoordinatesOrigin is given in the same units 
as the atomic coordinates. To study the eggbox effect we only need 
to scan the space between two grid points, but how do we know the distance
between the grid points? In a real simulation you would have to run
siesta with the MeshCutoff you want to check and look in the 
output for the actual grid that has been used. In this exercise 
we skip this step and we suppose that we already know that the
grid for this system with a cutoff of 100 Ry is 18x18x30. 
Using fractional atomic coordinates, 
this results in a distance between grid points of 1/30 = 0.03333...
Check that this is the maximum value of the series in the 
MgO.in file.

* Ensure that the MeshCutoff is set to 100 Ry and run the script:

$./autosiesta.py MgO

* At the end, the script will write a SystemLabel.#.out file for each
siesta run and a SystemLabel.script.out file with the values of the 
total energy and maximum force in each calculation. Plot the total 
energy as a function of the grid shift:

$gnuplot etc etc

* Edit the output and find the line that indicates the real space grid
used:

"InitMesh: MESH =    18 x    18 x    30"

* Repeat the exercise for a MeshCutoff value of 200 Ry. In this case
the grid will be 30x30x36, so the distance between grid points will be
1/36 = 0.0277777... in fractional units. Set the MeshCutoff to 200 Ry
in MgO.fdf and the maximum shift to 0.02777778 in MgO.in. Run the script,
and plot the results. Check again the actual space grid used and compare
the results.

* Repeat the exercise using a MeshCutoff of 200 Ry and the
%block GridCellSampling
 0.5 0.0 0.0
 0.0 0.5 0.0
 0.0 0.0 0.5
%endblock GridCellSampling

By how much the egg-box effect is reduced?.
