WARNING: BEFORE RUNNING A CALCULATION FOR PRODUCTION,
TEST THE PSEUDOPOTENTIAL AND BASIS SETS, AND PERFORM
THE CONVERGENCE TESTS (MESH CUTOFF, ETC.) 

IN THE PRESENT EXAMPLES, AND IN ORDER TO SPEED THE CALCULATIONS,
WE PROVIDE SOME VALUES OF THESE PARAMETERS FOR YOU.

WE DO NOT WARRANTY THAT THE VALUES OF THESE PARAMETERS ARE CONVERGED.

* Inspect the input file, h2o.fdf, and examine in detail 
the different input variables. More information can be obtained from 
the Siesta web page (http://www.icmab.es/siesta), following the link 
Documentations, and then Manual.

* Run Siesta using the default value of the supercell.
Inspect the output file, and check the value used for the default unit cell
and the dipole moment.

* Modify the input file to introduce the unit cell by hand.
For instance, if we want to simulate a cubic box with a length of 8.0 Ang,
introduce the following lines in the input file.

LatticeConstant     8.0 Ang
%block LatticeVectors
   1.0   0.0   0.0
   0.0   1.0   0.0
   0.0   0.0   1.0
%endblock LatticeVectors

* Run the code for a set of different lattice constants
For instance, from 8.0 Ang to 15.00 Ang in steps of 1.00 Ang.
Save each output file in a separate file:

siesta < h2o.fdf > h2o.your_lattice_constant.out

* Tabulate the total energy as a function of the lattice constant.
In order to get this, type:

grep "Total =" h2o.*.out > h2o.latcon.dat

* Edit the h2o.latcon.dat file with your favorite text editor,
and leave only two columns:
the first with the interatomic distance (in this case, in Angstroms),
and the second with the total energy (in this case, in eV).

* Plot the total energy as a function of the lattice constant.

gnuplot
plot "h2o.latcon.dat" using 1:2 with lines

Why the total energy depends on the lattice constant?.

* Plot the dipole as a function of the lattice constant.

grep "Electric dipole (a.u.)" h2o.*.out > h2o.dipole.dat

Edit the h2o.dipole.dat file and leave only four columns:
Lattice Constant (Ang)    Components of the dipole moment (electrons x bohr)

gnuplot
plot "h2o.dipole.dat" using 1:3 with lines

Study the convergence of the dipole moment with the size of the simulation box.
