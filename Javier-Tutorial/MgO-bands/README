WARNING: BEFORE RUNNING A CALCULATION FOR PRODUCTION,
TEST THE PSEUDOPOTENTIAL AND BASIS SETS, AND PERFORM
THE CONVERGENCE TESTS FOR THE MESH CUTOFF AND THE SAMPLING IN K-SPACE.

IN THE PRESENT EXAMPLES, AND IN ORDER TO SPEED THE CALCULATIONS,
WE PROVIDE SOME VALUES OF THESE PARAMETERS FOR YOU.

WE DO NOT WARRANTY THAT THE VALUES OF THESE PARAMETERS ARE CONVERGED.

* Edit the input file, MgO.fdf, and study the different variables.
Pay special attention to the new variables in this example, and
check their meaning in the User's Guide:
   BandLineScale
   %block BandLines

You can see the path chosen in k-space (%block BandLines) in this
example in the figure BrillouinZone.jpg in this folder.

* Select the lattice constant wich minimizes the total energy of the
system (in this case, you do not have to compute it; it is given to 
you and amounts to 4.117 Ang). Run the code setting the right lattice
constant in the input.
Once the input is ready, run a command like this:

siesta < MgO.fdf > MgO.out 

* Siesta write the bands information in a file called systemlabel.bands,
in this case MgO.bands. Take a look at this file with a text editor:

  - The first line of the file is the energy of the Fermi level.
  - The numbers in the second line are minimum and maximum of the path
    chosen in k-space.
  - The numbers in the third line are the minimum and maximum energies
    of the bands diagram.
  - The numbers in the fourth line are the numers of orbitals/bands 
    calculated, spin restricted (=1) or unrestricted (=2), and the
    total number of k-points where the bands have been calculated.
  - Then the bands are written in each k-point. Check that for each 
    k-point (first column) there are as many bands as the first number
    in the fourth line.
  - At the end of the file the high symmetry k-points are written.
    First the number of these points, and then in two columns, the 
    position in the path and their name.

* The file systemlabel.bands can be read using the file gnubands.f at
the folder Siesta-folder/Util/ 

To run it, execute:

<your_Fortran_90_compiler> -o gnubands.x gnubands.f
gnubands.x < MgO.bands > MgO.bands.gnuplot.dat
gnuplot
plot "MgO.bands.gnuplot.dat" using 1:2 with lines
set xrange [0.0:3.34]   # 3.34 is the position of last point in the path in k
set yrange [-30.0:25.0] # this is large enough to include all the valence bands
replot

The result is a plot with the band diagram of MgO. 

The you can argue if this system is an insulator, a semiconductor or a metal. 
What's the value of the gap?
Compare it with the experimental value 7.8 eV. 
Is it direct or indirect?
