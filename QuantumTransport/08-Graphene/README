Graphene is requiring lots of k-points for converging
the transport properties.

In this example you should learn two things:

 1) The importance of k-point sampling (much like example 04)

 2) The importance of describing the electrodes adequately
    with ONLY principal cell connections.
    For this you should check out the zig-zag example
    and try and change the supercell block in the electrode.
    Try with values 2 and 1 in the supercell block for the
    z-direction:
    %block SuperCell
     1 0 0 
     0 1 0
     0 0 <1|2>
    %endblock SuperCell
 
    After having re-runned the electrode, run transiesta.
    After having runned transiesta, how does it perform?
    Will it converge?
