How does k-points affect the tbtrans calculations?

Try and change the k-point grids for the tbtrans calculations.

First (as always) run the electrode, then transiesta, then
play with tbtrans and the k-point sampling.

 $> cd elec
 $> transiesta < elec.fdf | tee elec.out
 $> cd ..
 $> transiesta < stackingfault.fdf | tee stackingfault.out
 $> tbtrans < stackingfault.fdf | tee stackingfault.tbt-out

How does these changes affect the transport/DOS?
Will it converge?
