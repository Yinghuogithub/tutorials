In order to run the examples more easily I have created some scripts that
will run them automatically.

In order to execute the automatic scripts you need to have transiesta
in your path.
This can be done by putting the transiesta executable in a folder
that is existing in the environment variable PATH.
If this does not sound familiar you are encouraged to read about the
PATH environment variable and how to "unix add folders to PATH", I have
quoted it to be ready for a Google search.

The examples requires that you compile siesta, transiesta and tbtrans.
If you are in the top source folder of siesta
you should execute these commands:
 $> cd Obj
 $> make
 $> cp siesta <folder in your path>
 $> make clean
 $> make transiesta
 $> cp transiesta <folder in your path>
 $> cd ../Util/TS/TBtrans
 $> make
 $> cp tbtrans <folder in your path>

After having transiesta in your path you can simply do:
 $> ./run_TS.sh
which will run all the examples automatically.
In case you only want to run a single one of them do this:
 $> ./run-00.sh
to only run the 00 example.

In case you want to utilise your MPI installation you can call the 
examples via this construct:
 $> RUN="mpirun -np 2 transiesta" ./run_TS.sh
or
 $> RUN="mpirun -np 2 transiesta" ./run-00.sh
to execute transiesta using 2 MPI cores (this requires that you have
compiled siesta/transiesta with MPI.

However!! If I feel the question is more generic than just these examples
I will encourage you to ask on the SIESTA mailing list which I also follow.
