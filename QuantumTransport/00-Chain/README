 First example of TranSIESTA
=============================

Purpose:

Compare the siesta with transiesta for a perfect linear chain of Carbon 
atoms.
For perfectly symmetric systems the calculations are equivalent!

To compare siesta with transiesta we are going to do 3 calculations,
2 calculations related to transiesta and 
1 calculation done by siesta.

Why 2 calculations by transiesta?
=================================

transiesta is based on the description of electrodes and a "scattering" region.
transiesta requires the electrode calculation to be performed before calculating the
scattering region.

So the sequence will be:

 1) Run transiesta for the electrode:
     $> cd elec
     $> transiesta < elec.fdf | tee elec.out
    Once done you have calculated an electrode, the file "elec.TSHS" is found
    in the directory and contains the Hamiltonian of the electrode.

 2) In step 1) you calculated the electrode and we are now going to calculate the 
    "scattering" region.
    
    Assuming you have not changed directory since completing step 1) we go one
    directory up:
     $> cd ..
     $> transiesta < chain.fdf | tee chain.out

    This calculation takes some time. 
    If you look at the output you will see that it starts a regular siesta
    calculation, then moves on to do a transiesta calculation.

    Please have a look at the output, use either:
     $> more chain.out
    or 
     $> less chain.out

 3) Completing step 2) creates yet another Hamiltonian file "chain.TSHS".
    From this we can calculate the transmission (and other useful things).
    
    To calculate the transmission we use the utility called tbtrans
     $> tbtrans < chain.fdf | tee chain.tbt-out
    notice that we can use the same FDF file.

    We now have several extra files: 
     chain.TBT.*
    
   
 4) Before we can compare the transiesta calculation with the siesta 
    calculation we need to calculate it using siesta.

    Assuming you have not changed directory since completing step 2) we go 
    one directory up:
     $> cd ..
     $> cd siesta
    and call siesta on the chain
     $> siesta < chain.fdf | tee chain.out

    This will calculate the chain using ONLY k-points.

    After completion you will need to repeat the command from yesterday:
     $> Eig2DOS -f -m -10 -M 10 chain.EIG > chain.DOS
    which will calculate the density of states for the chain.

 5) Compare the two calculations:
    First go one directory up:
     $> cd ..
    Use your favourite plotting utility to plot both the siesta DOS 
    and the transiesta DOS.

     $> xmgrace -legend load chain.TBT.DOS siesta/chain.DOS
    or
     $> gnuplot -p
      >> plot "chain.TBT.AVDOS" u 1:2 w l, "siesta/chain.DOS" u 1:4 w l

    Note that comparing the two will not overlay them because of a normalization
    constant.
    TBtrans normalizes according to number of orbitals but Eig2DOS does not normalize.
    To compare the graphs one should divide the siesta/chain.DOS by 13 to achieve
    comparable DOS.

You have now completed the first example using transiesta, congratulations!

In the following examples you will follow steps 1) to 3) _every_ time! 
So if in doubt please re-read this documentation. 

However, note that the fdf file have different names in the different directories.
