 Utilising Bloch's theorem
===========================

In this example we will make use of Bloch's theorem
to reduce the size of the electrode and hence make the
calculation faster.

Any electrode which has a periodic arrangement in a cell
direction (not transport direction) is apt for Bloch's theorem.
It is ALWAYS adviced to utilise this method if applicable.

In this example we will cover the stacking fault example but
extend the surface and use a repeated electrode.


1. Run the calculation for the repetition as any normal
   transiesta calculation.
    a) Run electrode
    b) Run device
    c) Run tbtrans

2. For the advanced users:
   Try and make a copy of the device and create a system
   with 3 repetitions in the x-direction.
   HINT: Compare 02-SF structure with this
   structure. To figure out the way.
