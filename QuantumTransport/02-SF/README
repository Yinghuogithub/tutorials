 Bulk calculations using TranSIESTA
====================================

Transiesta can also deal with periodicities in the x-y plane.

Try and draw a simple system with periodicities.

HINT: Draw a large bulk system and put a molecule in between:
   -------------------------------------------
   |  Bulk           Vacuum            Bulk  |
   |  Bulk  \        Vacuum        /   Bulk  |
   |  Bulk    \      Vacuum      /     Bulk  |
   |  Bulk      \    Vacuum    /       Bulk  |
   |  Bulk          Molecule           Bulk  |
   |  Bulk      /    Vacuum    \       Bulk  |
   |  Bulk    /      Vacuum      \     Bulk  |
   |  Bulk  /        Vacuum        \   Bulk  |
   |  Bulk           Vacuum            Bulk  |
   -------------------------------------------

What implications might this have for your calculations?
 HINT: The calculation is still periodic in the transverse
       direction.
