As an exercise, generate and plot the "fatbands" and partial-DOS information
for MgO.

Follow the steps in the ../si_fatbands directory and in the
DAY-1/Visual/COHP/N_chain directory.

We have prepared for you the fatbands.mpr file, which can also be fed
to the program "mprop" to compute the partial DOS for the given
orbitals.
