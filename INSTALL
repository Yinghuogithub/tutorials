Assuming that, after unpacking, you have placed the material in directory

/some/path/to/package

you need to edit Config/tutorial.bashrc to make the main symbol point
to that directory:

SIESTA_EXERCISES=/some/path/to/package

The contents of this file should be read by the shell to import the environmental variables and aliases used by the package. In bash, you can use:

 . /some/path/to/package/Config/tutorial.bashrc

(and you can of course put a line like this in your $HOME/.bashrc )


** Depending on your particular kind of package, you might have already a
'bin' subdirectory populated with the executables for the tutorial. If not,
create it, and put in it copies of 

 siesta, atm, eig2dos, gnubands ...
