The Phonons-GeSi7 directory 
contains the results of frozen phonon calculation 
(after a precedent relaxation) for a GeSi7 supercell.
The calculated frequencies and eigenvectors are contaied in
GeSi_7.bands 
and
GeSi_7.vectors
From this, the vibration patterns in all phonon modes
(but the three acoustic ones) have been calculated
with the use of the vib2xsf script and saved as
GeSi7.Mode_*.XSF  (static xsf file with arrows), and
GeSi7.Mode_*.AXSF (animation xsf file). 

Exercises:

1. start 'xcrysden', open .XSF file(s), show vibration patters
with arrows, get acquainted with changing the vizualization 
parameters for the arrows. 

2. start 'xcrysden', open .AXSF file(s), show animation
of a phonon mode, get acquainted with manipulating 
the animation control box.

3. use 'vib2xsf' on the files from the 'vibrator' calculation,
select phonon modes to vizualized and obtain your own .XSF and .AXSF
files. (The old ones won't be overwritten because they have 
the prefix 'GeSi7' and the new ones would have 'GeSi_7').
Try 'xcryden' on your freshly generated .XSF and .AXSF files.
