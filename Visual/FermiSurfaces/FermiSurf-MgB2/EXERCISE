This directory contains structure and band structure data related
to the MgB2 compound. 
XCrySDen input files  MgB2.XSF  and  MgB2.BXSF  are already there,
for reference purposes. You'll have to create the corresponding files
by your own, using the available data with the prefix 'mgb2':
.XV, .KP and .EIG

Exercices:

1. produce mgb2.XSCF from mgb2.XV, using the script 'xv2xsf'.
Make acquaintance with the crystal sructure of MgB2. Extend the number
of unit cells drawn along three crystal vectors.

2. produce mg2.BXSF, using the script 'eig2bxsf'.
View the Fermi energy with XCrySDen. Try the modi of showing
the three Fermi surfaces separately, or all together. Switch between
visualization modi over the Brillouin zone, and the unit cell
in the reciprocal space (click the icons on the left of the main
window).
