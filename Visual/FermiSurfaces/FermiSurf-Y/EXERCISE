This directory contains structure and band structure data related
to hexagonal Ytrium.
XCrySDen input files  hcp_Y.XSF  and  hcp_Y.BXSF  are already there,
for reference purposes. You'll have to create the corresponding files
by your own, using the available data with the prefix 'hcp-Y':
.XV, .KP and .EIG

Exercices:

1. produce hcp-Y.XSCF from hcp-Y.XV, using the script 'xv2xsf'.
Make acquaintance with the hexagonal crystal sructure, extending the number
of unit cells drawn along three crystal vectors.

2. produce hcp-Y.BXSF, using the script 'eig2bxsf'.
View the Fermi energy with XCrySDen. Try the modi of showing
the three Fermi surfaces separately, or all together. Switch between
visualization modi over the Brillouin zone, and the unit cell
in the reciprocal space (click the icons on the left of the main
window).
