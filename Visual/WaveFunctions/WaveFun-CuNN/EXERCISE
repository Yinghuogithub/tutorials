The WaveFun-CuNN directory
contains the XCrySDen scripts with a visualization setup
for several molecular orbitals of a Cu hexafluoroacytilacetonate,
crystallized with a nitronyl nitroxide radical.

The directory contains two XCrySDen script files
WF513up.xcrysden  
WF520up.xcrysden
each restoring in full a working session of XCrySDen, stopped at some point. 
There files can be read in with
File -> Open Structure -> Open XCrySDen Scripting File
and NOT, as all other examples, via
File -> Open Structure -> Open XCF

Exercise:

Play around with visualization settings (colours, orientation
of molecule, light sources, transparency options, cutting planes...)
