Analysis of the COOP and COHP curves for a chain of N atoms
along the z axis.

* Run Siesta on the n_chain.fdf file.

Note the 'COOP.Write T' line in the file. This forces the creation of
the files n_chain.fullBZ.WFSX and n_chain.HSX, which contain wave-function
and Hamiltonian and Overlap information, respectively.

These files can be processed by the mprop program (full documentation
available typing 'mprop -h') to obtain the DOS, PDOS, COOP, and COHP
curves for an arbitrary combination of orbitals.

Before using mprop, issue the following command to link the WFSX file to
the name expected by the program:

ln -sf n_chain.fullBZ.WFSX n_chain.WFSX

The type:

'mprop pdos' to generate PDOS information (see file pdos.mpr). The
curves can be plotted with the pdos.gplot script: 'gp pdos.gplot'.

'mprop n_coo' to generate COOP and COHP curves. These display the
energy-resolved bonding and antibonding character in the system.
