The Relax-Graphite directory
contains the results of conjugate-gradient structure relaxation of graphite.
The (binary, obtained on an 32-bit Intel machine) molecular dynamics file
graphite.MD
is present

Exercise:

1. using 'md2axsf', create the .AXSF file
for the animation with XCrySDen. In case of problem reading
the binary .MD file, use the prepared
relaxation.AXSF
file.

2. Choose the setting (number of units drawn, spatial orientation)
in order to view the relaxation process with XCrySDen.
